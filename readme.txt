Thoughts: 
- Google fonts?
- Need to fix sidebar display & test cases
- Sticky header need to set up option for height
- Custom widgets?
- SEO: Schema markup - JSON LD started
- SEO: AMP - Accelerated Mobile Pages
- Blog post formats, sticky post, main posts page, single.php
- Notify on updates - Maybe done?
- Featured Images
- List of help options in customizer
- RECOMMENDED: No reference to add_editor_style() was found in the theme. It is recommended that the theme implement editor styling, so as to make the editor content match the resulting post output in the theme, for a better user experience.
- RECOMMENDED: Found the URL of a CDN in the code: maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome. You should not load CSS or Javascript resources from a CDN, please bundle them with the theme.
